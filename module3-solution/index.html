                <p>To this great Hector said: "Be well assur'd, wife, all these things
            in my kind cares are weigh'd, But what a shame and fear it is to think
            how Troy would scorn (Both in her husbands, and her wives, whom
            long-train'd gowns adorn) That I should cowardly fly off! The spirit I
            first did breathe Did never teach me that; much less, since the contempt
            of death Was settled in me, and my mind knew what a worthy was, Whose
            office is to lead in fight, and give no danger pass Without improvement.
            In this fire must Hector's trial shine; Here must his country, father,
            friends, be, in him, made divine. And such a stormy day shall come (in
            mind and soul I know) When sacred Troy shall shed her towers, for tears
            of overthrow; When Priam, all his birth and power, shall in those tears
            be drown'd. But neither Troy's posterity so much my soul doth wound,
            Priam, nor Hecuba herself, nor all my brothers'woes (Who, though so
            many, and so good, must all be food for foes,) As thy sad state; when
            some rude Greek shall lead thee weeping hence, These free days clouded,
            and a night of captive violence Loading thy temples, out of which thine
            eyes must never see, But spin the Greek wives'webs of task, and their
            fetch-water be To Argos, from Messe{"i}des, or clear Hyperia's spring;
            Which howsoever thou abhorr'st, Fate's such a shrewish thing She will be
            mistress; whose cursed hands, when they shall crush out cries From thy
            oppressions (being beheld by other enemies) Thus they will nourish thy
            extremes: 'This dame was Hector's wife, A man that, at the wars of Troy,
            did breathe the worthiest life Of all their army.'This again will rub
            thy fruitful wounds, To miss the man that to thy bands could give such
            narrow bounds. But that day shall not wound mine eyes; the solid heap of
            night Shall interpose, and stop mine ears against thy plaints and
            plight." This said, he reach'd to take his son; who, of his arms afraid,
            And then the horse-hair plume, with which he was so overlaid, Nodded so
            horribly, he cling'd back to his nurse, and cried. Laughter affected his
            great sire, who doff'd, and laid aside His fearful helm, that on the
            earth cast round about it light; Then took and kiss'd his loving son,
            and (balancing his weight In dancing him) those loving vows to living
            Jove he us'd, And all the other bench of Gods: "O you that have infus'd
            Soul to this infant, now set down this blessing on his star: Let his
            renown be clear as mine; equal his strength in war; And make his reign
            so strong in Troy, that years to come may yield His facts this fame,
            when, rich in spoils, he leaves the conquer'd field Sown with his
            slaughters: 'These high deeds exceed his father's worth.' And let this
            echo'd praise supply the comforts to come forth Of his kind mother with
            my life." This said, th'heroic sire Gave him his mother; whose fair eyes
            fresh streams of love's salt fire Billow'd on her soft cheeks, to hear
            the last of Hector's speech, In which his vows compris'd the sum of all
            he did beseech In her wish'd comfort. So she took into her odorous
            breast Her husband's gift; who mov'd to see her heart so much oppress'd,
            He dried her tears and thus desir'd: "Afflict me not, dear wife, With
            these vain griefs. He doth not live, that can disjoin my life And this
            firm bosom, but my fate; and Fate whose wings can fly? Noble, ignoble,
            Fate controls. Once born, the best must die. Go home, and set thy
            housewifery on these extremes of thought; And drive war from them with
            thy maids; keep them from doing nought. These will be nothing; leave the
            cares of war to men, and me, In whom, of all the Ilion race, they take
                their highest degree."</p>
